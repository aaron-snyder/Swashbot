# Swashbot
A pirate ship Discord bot. The files in this repository are strictly the C/C++ files used to run the program.
This repository does not include the D++ Discord API project files needed to run this program as an actual Discord Bot.
To run Swashbot as your own Discord Bot, visit https://dpp.dev/index.html#autotoc_md136, download a default bot,
and move these folders into the project folder. Happy pirating!
